# Project Ideas

Idea 1 - World Weather App (chosen)

World Weather is an app that allows you to search for different cities, find their current weather forecast, and save them to a favourites list. The app would require authentication and each user would have a different home page of their saved cities. I’ll be using either the Yahoo Weather API or the Weatherbit API.

Idea 2 - Soccer Stats Visualizer

Using the Footystats API to allow users to save their favourite players to a main dashboard. Selected players pinned to dashboard would display their most important stats depending on their position (Forward, Midfield, Defence) and I’d be using Grafana for the visualizations.

Idea 3 - Cocktail Recipe Finder

Using the Cocktail DB API, users would be prompted to search for ingredients and the app would return a list of all applicable recipes for cocktails. Users can then select and favourite recipes that will be accessed in a profile page.

All ideas include HTML/CSS/JS, API Usage, Authentication, Hashing, Python
